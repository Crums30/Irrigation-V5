# Installation[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)

### HACS installation
* Adding the repository using HACS is the simplest approach. The Custom Card deployed with the component, no need to install separately.

### Config Flow
* Define the program using the UI. From Setting, Devices & Services choose 'ADD INTEGRATION'. Search for Irrigation Controller Component. 
* Add the integration many times if you want more than one program.
* Modify programs and zones, add new zones, delete zones

### Basic Configuration
All entities to support the features are created automatically. You only need to provide the switches, valves for zones and pumps and external sensors that provide information to the system.

### Test configuration
[testhelpers.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/main/testhelpers.yaml) provides the helper configuration to support all the objects for three zones. A set of template switches for the zones and pump as well as inputs to emulate rain and flow sensors.

This allow you to test the program without triggering any 'real' solenoids, and will allow you to mimic your configuration in new versions to ensure an operational configuration after coming out your winter hinernation.

Be aware this is a sumulation, variatons in latency or behaviour of indivdual implementations will have an impact.

### Diagnostics
Diagnostic information can be downloaded and shared using from the integration menu

# Custom Card[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)
The custom card is installed with the component.
<img width="746" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c8d2d37-01ba-4dc7-8725-a8624d04c95d">

The card can be set to display one or more zones to support flexibility 
- The program selection will list only IrrigationProgram entities
- If no zones are selected all zones will be displayed in the card
- The show program option show/hides the program component of the card




# Features[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)
This section provides details of how the program operates.

### Start time
Four options are avilable to configure the start time. These can be selected from the 'Advanced option' menu in the configuration.
- Selector
  - Provides a time selector to input the scheduled start time.
- Multi time
  - Provides a text input to all the entry of multiple state times for a program, for example 6am and 6pm
- Sunrise
  - calculates the start time based on the sunrise time provided by the sun integration. A slider provides the ability to offset the time by +/- 4 hours
- Sunset
  - calculates the start time based on the sunset time provided by the sun integration. A slider provides the ability to offset the time by +/- 4 hours
### Frequency
The schedule can be configured to :
- To run every n days, 1 = every day, 2 = every two days and so on. 
- On specific week days, 'sun,tue,thu' will run the program on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday only.

The schedule can be set at:
- The program level to apply to all zones.
- On each zone. This allows the program to run different zones at varying tempos allowing the lawn to be watered weekly and the pots every 2.
- A combination of both
- If both are set the zone level frequency takes precidence.

### Enable options
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa08bd64-ab21-4176-9887-f18688ad7205)

Helpers are created to allow the disabling of the program or zones.
- Program is disabled
  - Program and zones will not start in any circumstance
- Zone is disabled
  - Will still start on the manual execution of the Program or zone
  - Will not start on a scheduled event

### Zone Transition
The zone transition sets the overlap or wait time between zones. This can be used to manage 'hammering' when zones stop and start, or support occasions where your solenoid requires back pressure to operate effectively.

### Disabling programs and zones
You can disable a program or zone.
- If the program is disabled it will not run when the scheduled
- If a zone is disabled it will not run when the rest of the schedule executes.
However when triggered manually from the interface the entire program will run.

### Impact of sensors
A number of sensors can be defined
- A rain sensor can be defined on each zone if active this will prevent the zone activating when executed via the schedule when it is active. It will run if actioned manually.
- Water source or well sensor, if inactive it will prevent any activation and stop running zones after a 5 second delay.
- Controller monitor, this monitors the avaialability of the controller hardware and prevents the program starting if inactive.
- Adjustment, this sensor is expected to provide a factor greater than or equal to 0, this is a multipler applied to the watering time/volume. Use this to adjust the amount of water applied less on rainy days more on hot days.

### Time v Volume
Watering can be controlled using time or if you have a calibrated flow sensor by volume.

### Pump or master solenoid
You can define a pump or master solenoid to be triggered with each zone. This valve will remain on for 5 seconds between zones to limit unnecessary cycling of the pump. If ECO mode is used the pump will shut down between cycles.

### ECO
Configuring ECO mode on a zone will provision the wait and repeat options. This is used to limit run off by allowing for multiple short watering cycles to encourage the water to penetrate the soil. Ideal for pot plants.

### Concurrent programs
You can configure multiple programs, by default if program executions overlap the second program will terminate the active one. This can be disabled in the advance options of the configuration. The setting must be updated on each program instance.

### Next run behaviour
The next run is set from the start time and frequency provided. Changing the start time forward will initialise a new run if it has already run on that day.

### Last ran
This is set after any successfull completion of the zone. All zones triggered together will have the same Last ran value set.





# Configuration[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)
The configuration of the program initiates the creation of supporting helper entities that support the provision of the various capabilities.

## Program definition

### Name
The name of the program is used to generate a recognisable switch entity that is the foundation of the component.

### Program wide frequency
This provides the frequency of operation for all zones that do not have a specific frequency option defined. If you intend to enable independent frequency for each zone this can be disabled.

### Frequency options
The options selected/created here are used across the program and zone frequency selectors.
This supports:
- numeric values: 1 = every day, 2 = every second day and so on.
- day of week: valid values are mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat,sun. When mon is selected the program will only execute on Monday
- day groups: mon,wed,thu. When selected the program will run on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.

### Monitor controller
This option supports monitoring if the controller is online. If the controller is offline the program will not attempt to start.

### Controller type
If you have a RainBird controller this will result in the RainBird API being used to start the zones bypassing the default runtime limitation.

## Zone Definition

### Zone
The Valve or Switch that is exposed in home assistant that operates the irrigation solenoid.

### Zone Frequency
Specifying the Zone frequency option will provide the ability for a zone to have an independent frequency from the rest of the program. For example, pot plants can be watered daily but lawns every three days in a single program definition.

üìù The frequency options are defined in the program configuration.

### ECO feature
Selecting the ECO feature will provide the Wait/Repeat options to support multiple short watering cycles to limit the run off. Particularly useful to allow water to penetrate pot plants.

### Pump
Defining the Pump valve/switch supports the control of a pump or master solenoid. The pump remains on for five seconds after a zone completes.

### Flow sensor
When defined the system operates on the delivery of volume rather than watering for a specified time. 
- The flow sensor is monitored to determine the volume of water delivered for each cycle.
- When coupled with the ECO setting the specified volume is delivered for each repeated cycle.
- When the Adjustment sensor is defined the volume to be delivered will be adjusted by thefactor provided

### Adjustment Sensor
It is expected that the senor will provide a multiplying factor to change the defined watering time. If there has been rain or rain is expected you could reduce the watering requirement or if a hot spell is expected you can increase the watering requirement.

üí°check out this component [OpenWeatherMap History](https://github.com/petergridge/openweathermaphistory)

### Rain Sensor
This expects a true/false binary input. If the value is True the zone will be suspended and the zone status indication updated. Watering will continue if the rain sensor is activated once watering commences.

### Water Source
This expects a true/false binary input. Used to monitor a well status and prevent watering if the water drops below a certain level. Watering will be stopped if this sensor is activated.

### Zone Order
Use this to alter the run sequence of the zones. The value increments by 10 as a default to support easier redefinition of the sort order.


## Advanced options

### Concurrent program execution (interlock)
This option allows or prevents two programs executing concurrently, when enabled (default) the second program to run will terminate the running program. A log entry will is created to highlight the occurrence.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: if programs have identical start times one program will fail to start when interlock is enabled.

### Start time options
Options available:
- Time selector, supporting the selction of a single start time for the program
- Multistart, provides an text input that accepts multiple start times for example 08:00:00,18:00:00 to run at 6am and 6pm. 
- Sunrise, this provides the base start time of sunrise with an option to offet the time using a numeric slider
- Sunset, this provides the base start time of sunset with an option to offet the time using a numeric slider

Sunrise and sunset are obtained from the SUN integration.
